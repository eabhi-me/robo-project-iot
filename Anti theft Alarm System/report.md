# Project Report: Anti-Theft Alarm System

## Project Report on Anti-Theft Alarm System Using Ultrasonic Sensor

### 1. Introduction
This project presents an anti-theft alarm system using an ultrasonic sensor to detect unauthorized access and alert users.

### 2. Objectives
- Detect unauthorized access.
- Alert users via an alarm system.
- Use ultrasonic technology for precise motion detection.
- Develop a cost-effective security system.

### 3. Components Used
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- Servo Motor (SG90)
- Transistor (2N2222)
- Arduino Uno (Microcontroller)
- Buzzer & LED Indicator
- Power Supply (9V Battery/Adapter)

### 4. Working Principle
The ultrasonic sensor emits waves that reflect upon hitting an object. The microcontroller processes the signal to detect motion, triggering the buzzer and LED if an object is within the set range.

### 5. Circuit & Implementation
The ultrasonic sensor connects to an Arduino, which processes distance data and activates alarms when unauthorized movement is detected.

### 6. Algorithm & Programming
1. Initialize components.
2. Measure distance via ultrasonic waves.
3. Compare distance with threshold.
4. Activate buzzer and LED if needed.
5. Continuously monitor for intrusion.

### 7. Applications
- Home & Office Security
- Industrial Surveillance
- Vehicle Protection

### 8. Advantages
- Real-time alerts
- Cost-effective & low power
- Easy integration with other security systems

### 9. Limitations
- Limited detection range
- Susceptible to environmental interference
